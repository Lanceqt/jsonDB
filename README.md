# jsonDB: A Lightweight JSON Database Module for Deno

jsonDB is an easy-to-use database module designed specifically for the Deno runtime environment. It allows developers to perform essential CRUD operations on JSON data stored as documents, offering a lightweight and flexible solution for a variety of applications.

## What jsonDB is:

-   A database module built for Deno, providing a simple interface for interacting with JSON data stored in files

-   Ideal for lightweight applications not requiring a full-featured database

-   Well-suited for managing configuration files, temporary data storage, or small-scale projects

## What jsonDB is not:

-   A replacement for full-fledged database systems like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL

-   Suitable for applications that require advanced querying capabilities, transactions, or real-time data synchronization

-   Optimized for high-performance or large-scale applications with extensive storage requirements or complex data relationships

## Usage

```html
<script src="jsonDB/mod.js" type="module"></script>
```

```js
import { jsonDB } from "";
```

## Disclaimer: Work-in-Progress

Please be aware that jsonDB is a work-in-progress project developed by a single individual. While I have put considerable effort into designing and testing the module, there might be undiscovered issues or limitations. I encourage users to provide feedback or report issues, as it helps me improve jsonDB for the community. By using jsonDB, you acknowledge its current status and potential for future refinements.
