# jsonDB: A Lightweight, Cross-Environment JSON Database Module

jsonDB is a versatile and easy-to-use database module designed to work seamlessly with Deno, Node.js, and browser environments. It enables developers to perform essential CRUD operations on JSON data stored as documents, providing a lightweight and flexible solution for various applications.

## What jsonDB is:

-   A cross-platform database module supporting Deno, Node.js, and browser environments

-   A simple interface for interacting with JSON data stored in files

-   Designed for lightweight applications that do not require a full-featured database
    Ideal for managing configuration files, temporary data storage, or small-scale projects

## What jsonDB is not:

-   A replacement for full-fledged database systems like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL

-   Suitable for applications that require advanced querying capabilities, transactions, or real-time data synchronization

-   Optimized for high-performance or large-scale applications with substantial storage requirements or complex data relationships

## Usage

```js
import { jsonDB } from "";
```

## Disclaimer: Work-in-Progress

Please be aware that jsonDB is a work-in-progress project developed by a single individual. While I have put considerable effort into designing and testing the module, there might be undiscovered issues or limitations. I encourage users to provide feedback or report issues, as it helps me improve jsonDB for the community. By using jsonDB, you acknowledge its current status and potential for future refinements.
